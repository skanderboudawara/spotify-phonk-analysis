### Description:
Phonks is a Music genra that I started listening to when practicing my Gym sessions ðŸ’ª. 

I wanted to investigate some data related to this genra on spotify and It was a way for me to learn Dash/Plotly that is a great library.

I decided to focus on 4 plots:
- The count of phonk tracks of the years 
- The streams of phonk over the years
- A scatter plot to see if there is a relation between the number of tracks released and streams over the country
- A pie chart to see the percentage of explicit content in Phonk music
